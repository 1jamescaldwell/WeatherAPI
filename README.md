# WeatherAPI
(Personal project)

I wrote this script to send a notification to my phone every day that the temperature will reach below freezing overnight. Backstory: we had a pipe burst winter 2022, so I want to make sure our faucet is dripping and cabinets are open every night it will be below freezing.
